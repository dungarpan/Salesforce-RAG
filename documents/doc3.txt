Cloud Computing Overview

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, and analytics over the internet. Instead of owning physical infrastructure, organizations can access technology resources on-demand from cloud providers.

The main cloud service models are Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Popular cloud providers include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

Benefits of cloud computing include cost savings, scalability, flexibility, and automatic software updates. Cloud computing has revolutionized how businesses operate, enabling remote work, global collaboration, and rapid innovation.
